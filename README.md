# AI Food Detection - Helping Families Avoid UPF Foods

> *Created by [Ade Bambang Kurnia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adebmbng/) to help his daughter Alula manage H. Pylori bacteria by avoiding chocolate and minimizing Ultra-Processed Foods (UPF).*

An AI-powered web application that uses camera detection to identify food products and categorize them by processing level using the NOVA classification system. Built with React, TypeScript, and AI to help families make informed dietary choices.

## üéØ Why This App Exists

When my daughter Alula was diagnosed with H. Pylori bacteria, our doctor advised us to:
- Avoid chocolate completely
- Minimize Ultra-Processed Foods (UPF)
- Control food intake carefully

As a developer and concerned parent, I realized many families face similar challenges. This app was born from the need to quickly and accurately assess whether foods are safe for dietary restrictions like H. Pylori management.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Camera Detection** - Point and analyze food instantly
- **NOVA Classification** - Categorizes foods as Unprocessed, Minimally Processed, Processed, or Ultra-Processed
- **Health Scoring** - Visual health score (1-10) based on processing level
- **Confidence Levels** - AI confidence scoring for analysis accuracy
- **Family-Friendly** - Designed with dietary restrictions in mind
- **Share Results** - Share analysis with family members or healthcare providers
- **Mobile-First** - Optimized for smartphone use

## üè• Health Categories

### ü•¨ Unprocessed (Health Score: 10/10)
Fresh fruits, vegetables, raw nuts, fresh herbs
*Generally safe for H. Pylori management*

### ü•´ Minimally Processed (Health Score: 7-8/10)
Frozen vegetables, plain yogurt, canned beans, dried fruits
*Usually acceptable with medical guidance*

### üßÄ Processed (Health Score: 4-6/10)
Cheese, bread, canned vegetables, smoked meats
*Requires careful consideration*

### üçü Ultra-Processed (Health Score: 1-3/10)
Packaged snacks, soft drinks, ready meals, processed meats
*Should be avoided with H. Pylori and similar conditions*
